    "expected_result": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight energy. The light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of chemical reactions. The glucose is then used by the plant for growth and energy, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere.",
